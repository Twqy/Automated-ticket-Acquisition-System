Automated Ticket Acquisition System
About:
I developed a Python-based automation tool using Selenium WebDriver that secures tickets for high-demand university events, specifically the UWCSA St. Patrick's Day celebration that typically sells out within seconds.

Goal:
This system solves the challenge of acquiring multiple tickets simultaneously when they become available, completing all registration and payment steps automatically with minimal human intervention.

Features
Dynamic ticket element detection across website updates
Multi-user registration for up to 7 attendees
Automated form completion and waiver acceptance
Secure payment processing through iframe navigation
